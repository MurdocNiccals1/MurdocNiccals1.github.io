              <p>
                Legion Logistics was founded on the 21st of August 2020. The VTC
                was started with the intention of bringing members from the ETS2
                and ATS community together. Our founder created the company not
                knowing much about VTC's or the work that goes into creating a
                successful VTC but one thing he knew was that Legion Logistics
                will on day join along side some of the biggest names in the
                community. Within a couple days,various drivers from around the
                world came and registered as a Legion Logistics driver. To this
                day, players from across the globe are recognising Legion
                Logistics and are joining the ever expanding community that has
                been created.

                        What do we plan to do next. With Legion Logistics
                        growing and our driver count growing we will be working
                        to improve our driver satisfaction. We’ll be releasing
                        lots of new features and updates for our drivers, many
                        of which are now being developed. We’re improving the
                        overall quality of our community by adding more of what
                        the drivers want, removing inactive drivers as well as
                        recruiting skilled and experienced staff members. With
                        new additions regularly being added and our drivers
                        beating the roads, the future of Legion Logistics is a
                        bright one.
